Non-Transient Swarms
--------------------

Non-Transient Swarms are swarms of servers which hold common content.
Ideaily these servers would agree to cooperate to make this common
content available and even perhaps coordinate mirroring of the 
content between themselves.

Swarmget was inspired by BitTorrent.
